# Getting Started with PortalVue

## What is PortalVue?

PortalVue is a set of two components that allow you to render a component's template
(or a part of it) anywhere in the document - even outside of your the part that is controlled by your Vue App!

### Simple Example

```html
<portal to="destination">
  <p>This slot content will be rendered wherever the <portal-target> with name 'destination'
    is located.
  </p>
</portal>

<portal-target name="destination">
  <!--
  This component can be located anwhere in your App.
  The slot content of the above portal component will be rendered here.
  -->
</portal-target>
```

See it in action in this fiddle:

## Setup

Install Package:
```bash
npm install --save portal-vue
# or with yarn
yarn add portal-vue
```
Add it to your application:
```javascript
import PortalVue from 'portal-vue'

Vue.use(PortalVue)
```

For more detailed Installation instructions, additional options and Installation via CDN,
see the <a href="#" router-link="/docs/installation">Installation</a> Page in the Documentation.

## Feature Examples

### Enabling/Disabling the Portal
```html
<portal to="destination" :disabled="true">
  <p>
    This slot content will be rendered right here as long as the `disabled` prop evaluates to `false`,<br>
    and will be rendered at the defined destination as when it is set to `true`
  </p>
</portal>
```

### v-if works, too

```html
<portal to="destination" v-if="usePortal">
  <ul>
    <li>
      When 'userPortal' evaluates to 'true', the portal's slot content will be rendered
      at the destination.
    </li>
    <li>
      When it evaluates to 'false', the content will be removed from the detination
    </li>
  </ul>
</portal>
```

### Switching targets and sources

The `to` prop of `<portal>` and the `name` prop of `<portal-target>` can be changed dynamically with `v-bind`.

```html
<portal v-bind:to="name">
  Content will be dynamically sent to the destination that `name` evaluates to
</portal>

<portal-target v-bind:name="name">
  by changing the 'name', you can define which portal's content should be shown.
</portal-target>
```
### Rendering outside of the Vue-App

```html
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <portal name="" target-el="#widget">
      <p>
        PortalVue will dynamically mount an  instance of <portal-target> in place of the Element
        with `id="widget"`, and this paragraph will be rendered inside of it.
      </p>
    </portal>
  </div>
  <script>
    new Vue({el: '#app'})
  </script>
  <aside id="widget" class="widget-sidebar">
    This Element is not controlled by our Vue-App, but we can create a <portal-target> there dynamically.
  </aside>
</body>
```

## But why?

### Working around `position: fixed` issues

In older browsers, `position: fixed` works unreliably when the element with that property
is nested in a node tree that has other `position` values.

But we normally need it to render components like modals, dialogs, notifications, snackbars
and similar UI elements in a fixed position.

With PortalVue, you can instead render the component to a `<portal-target>` that you can position
as the first child of your `#app` element.

Now you can position your components with `position: absolute` instead

```html
<body>
  <div id="app" style="position: relative;">
    <portal-target name="notification-outlet"></portal-target>
    <div></div>
    <div>
      <portal to="notification-outlet">
        <notification style="position: absolute; top: 20px; right: 20px;">
          This modal can be positioned absolutely, working around problems with 'fixed'
        </notification>
      </portal>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

### Rendering dynamic widgets

If you use Vue for small bits and pieces on your website, but want to render something in a location at the other end of the page, PortalVue got you covered.
